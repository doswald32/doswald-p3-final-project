# Dan's Phase 3 Final Project

## Overview

Welcome! In just a few easy steps, you'll be able to operate a library database where you can access library patrons and the books they've checked out.

## Accessing the CLI

Fork and clone this repository to your local machine. Once in the directory, be sure to run pipenv install to install the necessary dependencies, and then run pipenv shell to enter the virtual environment. From there, simply run "python lib/cli.py" to enter the CLI. Your available actions will be explained by the CLI. 

Enjoy!
